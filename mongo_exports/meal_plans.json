Add the garlic and cook for 1 min, then add the spices and stir. Cook for a couple of minutes more until the spices become aromatic, then add half the lime juice and season. Transfer to a dish, leaving any juices behind, and keep warm. Tip the black beans into the same pan then add the remaining lime juice and plenty of seasoning. Stir the beans around the pan to warm them through and help them absorb any flavors of the fajita mix, then stir through the coriander. Warm the tortillas in a microwave or in a low oven, then wrap them so they don’t dry out. Serve the tortillas with the fajita mix, beans, avocado and sour cream.","category":"egg free/ lupin free/ nut free/ sesame free/ soy free","cho":51.6,"protein":14.2,"fat":16.7,"energy":405,"image":"fajita.png","__v":0}
